description = "Start a Ralph Wiggum iterative development loop for self-referential task completion."
prompt = """
You are initiating a Ralph Wiggum loop - an iterative, self-referential development methodology for Gemini CLI.

**IMPORTANT:** First, run the setup script to create the loop state file:
```bash
bash "${extensionPath}/scripts/setup-ralph-loop.sh" $ARGUMENTS
```

The script accepts these arguments:
- The task prompt (required) - what you want to accomplish
- `--max-iterations <n>` - Stop after N iterations (default: unlimited)
- `--completion-promise '<text>'` - Phrase that signals completion (USE QUOTES for multi-word)

**Examples:**
```bash
bash "${extensionPath}/scripts/setup-ralph-loop.sh" Build a REST API --max-iterations 20
bash "${extensionPath}/scripts/setup-ralph-loop.sh" --completion-promise 'DONE' Fix the auth bug
```

**After running the script:**
1. Read the state file at `.gemini/ralph-loop.local.md` to understand your task
2. Work on the task iteratively
3. Each iteration, check your progress and continue improving
4. If a completion promise is set, output `<promise>YOUR_PHRASE</promise>` when genuinely complete

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Do NOT output a false completion promise to exit the loop
- Trust the iterative process - keep improving until the task is genuinely complete
- Check `.gemini/ralph-loop.local.md` for current iteration count and settings

**To cancel the loop:** Use `/cancel-ralph` command
